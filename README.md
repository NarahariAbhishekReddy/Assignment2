<b> Question1</b>
<b>a.</b><hr>
<p> In the first step I have taken 25 random observations from the population and stored it into the sample</br>
Then we have calculated the mean and the maximum glucose values for the sample and the population</br>
Then plotted these vslues on a box plot which gives the various glucose statistics for the population and the sample</br>

<b>b.</b>
<hr>
<p> In this question we have created a function to caluculate the BMI values at the 98th percentile for the sample and population</br>
Then plotted these values on a bar graph which displays the BMI values at 98th percentile for the sample and the population</br></p>
<hr>
<b>c.</b>
<p> In this question using bootstrap (replace= True), we have created 500 samples (of 150 observation each) from the
population and find the average mean, standard deviation and percentile for BloodPressure </br>
After finding these values we have plotted them on a bar graph. We can analyze from the graph  that he 95th percentile, mean, standard deviation, and other statistics for the 'BloodPressure' variable from the bootstrap samples closely match those from the population. This shows that for the 'BloodPressure' variable, the bootstrap samples are representative of the population and the sample statistics are accurate approximations of the population statistics. However, it's important to note that the findings are based on the specific dataset used in this analysis and may not necessarily apply to other datasets or populations. It is always advised to carefully assess the results' interpretation in light of the particular environment in which the data were collected</br>
